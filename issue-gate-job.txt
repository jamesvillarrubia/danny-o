## Problem

The GATE job is generated with dependencies on test jobs (e.g., `test-api`, `test-extension`, `test-web`) even when no test jobs were actually created in the custom jobs section. This causes the workflow to fail because it references jobs that don't exist.

## Current Behavior

When running `pipecraft generate`, the GATE job is created with:
```yaml
gate:
  needs: [ version, test-api, test-extension, test-web ]
  if: ${{ ... needs.test-api.result ... needs.test-extension.result ... needs.test-web.result ... }}
```

However, if the user hasn't created these test jobs in the custom section, the workflow fails with errors like:
- "Job 'test-api' not found"
- "Job 'test-extension' not found"
- "Job 'test-web' not found"

## Expected Behavior

The GATE job should:
1. Only reference test jobs that actually exist in the workflow
2. Dynamically detect which test jobs were created
3. Or provide a way to configure which test jobs to gate on
4. Handle the case where no test jobs exist gracefully

## Impact

- Workflows fail immediately if test jobs aren't created
- Users must manually edit the GATE job to remove non-existent job references
- Confusing error messages that don't clearly indicate the problem
- Forces users to create placeholder test jobs even if they don't need them

## Suggested Fix

1. Detect which test jobs actually exist in the workflow before generating GATE dependencies
2. Only include existing test jobs in the `needs` array
3. Provide a configuration option to specify which jobs should be gated
4. Make the GATE job optional or handle missing jobs gracefully
5. Add validation that warns if GATE references non-existent jobs
