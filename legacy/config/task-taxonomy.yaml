notes: |
  This taxonomy evolves with your life and work. Update it as:
  - New projects emerge (e.g., new book, new client)
  - Old projects complete (archive labels)
  - Patterns emerge that need new labels
  - Descriptions need clarification
  
  The AI uses this file to:
  - Understand your project structure
  - Suggest appropriate classifications
  - Learn your patterns over time
  - Generate better prompts
